Offcloud.com API v.1
===============

## Introduction to the Offcloud.com API

Offcloud API is a solution that gives developers ability to interact with Offcloud.com service, including:

* Adding an URL to Offcloud for Instant downloading
* Adding an URL to Offcloud cloud.
* Adding an URL to Offcloud for Remote downloading

All requests return JSON, including errors. All parameters should be passed to API scripts as POST request variables.


## Authentificate to the Offcloud.com API

You authenticate to the Offcloud by sending credentials to https://offcloud.com/api/login/classic 

Parameters are:

* username: actual e-mail of the registered user
* password: password of the registered user

If authentication succeeds, the script will return the following data in JSON format:

* email
* userId

For example:

```json
{
  "email": "test@test.com",
  "userId": "53f89e52822c8bf413000008"
}
```

In case of error, the script will return error message. For example:

```json
{
  "error": "Please enter a valid email address."
}
```

To send the further requests you must pass the cookie “connect.sid” returned by auth request.


## Submitting an input to Offcloud.com through the API

### Adding an URL for instant downloading

To add an URL for instant downloading, pass the following variables to the script:

```
https://offcloud.com/api/instant/download
```

* url: URL of downloaded resource
* proxyId: (optional) ID of the preferred proxy server to use. If proxyId is not specified,  the default user proxy server will be used

In the case of success, the script will return the following JSON answer:
* requestId
* fileName: the name of the requested file
* url: url for instant download
* site: website name
* status: status of the requested file. Should be ‘created’
* originalLink: link to the original file
* createdOn: date and time when request was processed

In the case when adding this URL is not available for this user, API will return the following JSON answer:
* not_available

Here are the following values of the ‘not_available’ response and their descriptions:

| Name | Description          |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| premium      | User must purchase a premium downloading addon for this download.|

## Examples

Because API uses cookies to authenticate requests, the simplest way to use API is to write a browser script. Here are some examples of jQuery API calls:

##### Authorization:

``` js
$.ajax({
    url: 'https://offcloud.com/api/login/classic',
    data: {username: 'test@test.com', password: 'test'},
    type: 'POST',
    crossDomain: true, // enable this
xhrFields: {
    withCredentials: true
},
    success: function(data) { console.log(data); },
    error: function() { console.log('Failed!'); }
});	
```

#####  Adding an URL for Instant downloading:

```js
$.ajax({
    url: 'https://offcloud.com/api/instant/download',
    data: {'url' : 'http://www.cnn.com'},
    type: 'POST',
    crossDomain: true, // enable this
xhrFields: {
    withCredentials: true
},
    success: function(data) { console.log(data); },
    error: function() { console.log('Failed!'); }
});	
```

#####  Retrieving a list of available remote accounts:

```js
$.ajax({
    url: 'https://offcloud.com/api/remote-account/list',
    data: { },
    type: 'POST',
    crossDomain: true, // enable this
xhrFields: {
    withCredentials: true
},
    success: function(data) { console.log(data); },
    error: function() { console.log('Failed!'); }
});	
```
